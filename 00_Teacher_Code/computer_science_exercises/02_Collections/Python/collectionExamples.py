testScores = [15, 25, 99, 73, 25] # Integers
gradePointAvg = [1.99, 2.5, 3.75, 4.0, 0.99] # Floats
courseOptions = ["Math", "Science", "Reading", "Gym"]

# Printing List Items -- v0.1b

print(testScores[0]) # Print the first item in the list. 
print(gradePointAvg[0]) # Print the first item in the list.
